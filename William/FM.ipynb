       "      <td>Marrakesh is a unique dining experience hidden away in a South Philadelphia alleyway. \\n\\nAmbiance:\\nMarrakesh is all about the experience. You start by walking down an alley off of South Street to ring the doorbell. You are greeted by one of the waiters and instantly walk into a dimly lit Moroccan evening. The tables are low and rapped by benches instead of chairs. The walls and floors are draped in rugs and a belly dancer is performing on one of the many levels at any given time. The dining room is organized into several different rooms across the levels so, while tightly packed, every dinner feels intimate. Marrakesh is best enjoyed as a group, as tables seem to be made for 4-15 diners rather than one or two. \\n\\nFood:\\nThe food here is good. Every diner enjoys a tasting menu that starts with an appetizer of different types of moroccan salad, is followed by a chicken course, and then a choice between beef and lamb. The meal finishes with a couscous course, a fruit course, and mint tea accompanied by Baklava. The staff is able to make the main courses spicy or non-spicy and vegetarian options are available - even if its just one person out of the group. All of the dishes were good and definitely had the punch of flavor I'd expect from Moroccan food. \\n\\nDrink:\\nThis restaurant is BYOB. They seem to sell some drinks from some of the other reviews, however its not well advertised and I was unclear of what they offered so I brought my own. $3 per person uncorking fee. \\n\\nService:\\nThe staff definitely tries to accomodate everyone and provide a great experience. . My biggest complaint is that they don't offer silverware! Save for the couscous, you are forced to eat every dish with your hands or pita bread - no wonder they give you a bath towel instead of a napkin! When we asked for a fork and knife for our chicken, they informed us that they did not have any. Marrakesh should at least keep some on hand for those diners that are less adventurous about eating with their hands. \\n\\nValue:\\nYou get a lot of bang for your buck at Marrakesh. For only $35 a person (gratuity included), you leave having tasted a wide range of Moroccan food and feeling stuffed. Absolutely recommend you go here at least once for the experience - but come hungry!</td>\n",

Maybe I'm just not appreciative of the subtleties of coffee as I should be, but I'll stick with black and brew.   \n",
       "80184  Marrakesh is a unique dining experience hidden away in a South Philadelphia alleyway. \\n\\nAmbiance:\\nMarrakesh is all about the experience. You start by walking down an alley off of South Street to ring the doorbell. You are greeted by one of the waiters and instantly walk into a dimly lit Moroccan evening. The tables are low and rapped by benches instead of chairs. The walls and floors are draped in rugs and a belly dancer is performing on one of the many levels at any given time. The dining room is organized into several different rooms across the levels so, while tightly packed, every dinner feels intimate. Marrakesh is best enjoyed as a group, as tables seem to be made for 4-15 diners rather than one or two. \\n\\nFood:\\nThe food here is good. Every diner enjoys a tasting menu that starts with an appetizer of different types of moroccan salad, is followed by a chicken course, and then a choice between beef and lamb. The meal finishes with a couscous course, a fruit course, and mint tea accompanied by Baklava. The staff is able to make the main courses spicy or non-spicy and vegetarian options are available - even if its just one person out of the group. All of the dishes were good and definitely had the punch of flavor I'd expect from Moroccan food. \\n\\nDrink:\\nThis restaurant is BYOB. They seem to sell some drinks from some of the other reviews, however its not well advertised and I was unclear of what they offered so I brought my own. $3 per person uncorking fee. \\n\\nService:\\nThe staff definitely tries to accomodate everyone and provide a great experience. . My biggest complaint is that they don't offer silverware! Save for the couscous, you are forced to eat every dish with your hands or pita bread - no wonder they give you a bath towel instead of a napkin! When we asked for a fork and knife for our chicken, they informed us that they did not have any. Marrakesh should at least keep some on hand for those diners that are less adventurous about eating with their hands. \\n\\nValue:\\nYou get a lot of bang for your buck at Marrakesh. For only $35 a person (gratuity included), you leave having tasted a wide range of Moroccan food and feeling stuffed. Absolutely recommend you go here at least once for the experience - but come hungry!   \n",
